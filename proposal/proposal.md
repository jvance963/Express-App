<h2> CONCEPT </h2>

<p> Not all of us are good at every-thing and sometimes we need help. </p>

<p> One may usually use something like https://www.taskrabbit.com/dashboard for their needs for around the house. However, what if your needs extend beyond the every-day jobs around the house.</p>

<p> I am interested in building an application that helps everyone navigate through life and leverage the community around them to become successful in their daily or work lives. </p>

<h2> CRUD Functionality </h2>

<ul>
<li>CREATE User</li>
<li>CREATE Job</li>
<li>CREATE Handyman</li>
<li>CREATE Response from Handyman</li>
<li>READ All Responses from Handyman</li>
<li>READ Job</li>
<li>UPDATE Response from Handyman</li>
<li>UPDATE Job</li>
<li>DELETE Job</li>
<li>DELETE User</li>

</ul>

<h2> Models </h2>

<p> I am going to be building 4 models for this application. They will be for the

<ul>user</ul>
<li>login</li>
<li>Sign-up</li>
<ul>job</ul>
<li>Create</li>
<li>Edit</li>
<li>Delete</li>
<ul>response</ul>
<li>New</li>
<li>Edit</li>
<li>Delete</li>

<h2> CONSIDERATIONS </h2>

<p> I will be a challenge to link everything together and making the MVC work correctly.</p>

<p>I plan on using {{{ handlebars }}}for my template library.</P>

<p>I am thinking about using feathers but I have to look into it a little more.</p>

<h2>REACH</h2>

<p>I am going to want to create a user, a "jobber" (to respond to the job). I will also want to create a signup page and I think that is it for now.</p>
