<h2> CONCEPT </h2>

<p> Not all of us are good at every-thing and sometimes we need help. </p>

<p> One may usually use something like https://www.taskrabbit.com/dashboard for their needs for around the house. However, what if your needs extend beyond the every-day jobs around the house.</p>

<p> I am interested in building an application that helps everyone navigate through life and leverage the community around them to become successful in their daily or work lives. </p>

<h2> CRUD Functionality </h2>

<ul>
CREATE User
CREATE Job
CREATE Handyman
CREATE Response from Handyman
READ All Responses from Handyman
READ Job
UPDATE Response from Handyman
UPDATE Job
DELETE Job
DELETE User

</ul>

<h2> Models </h2>

<p> I am going to be building 4 models for this application. They will be for the

<li>
- "user",
  - login
  - Sign-up
- "job",
  - Create
  - Edit
  - Delete
- "response"
  - New
  - Edit
  - Delete
</li>

<h2> CONSIDERATIONS </h2>

<p> I will be a challenge to link everything together and making the MVC work correctly.</p>

<p>I plan on using {{{ handlebars }}}for my template library.</P>

<p>I am thinking about using feathers but I have to look into it a little more.</p>

<h2>REACH</h2>

I am going to want to create a user, a "jobber" (to respond to the job). I will also want to create a signup page and I think that is it for now.
